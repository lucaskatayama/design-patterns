# Factory Method Pattern

## Definition
> Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface which encapsulates object creation, and lets the subclasses decide what objects to create.

## Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
> Every method should have only ONE responsibility


### Open/Close Principle
> The class should be **open for extension** and **close for modification**

## Examples

1. First implementation
Needs refactoring, it doesn't satisfy:
 - Single Responsibility Principle
 - Open/Close Principle
