# Flyweight Pattern

#Definition
> Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of a object state among multiple objects, instead of keeping it in each object separately.

Use:  
  - Many similar objects are used and the storage cost is high
  - The majority of each object's state data can be made extrinsic
  - A few shared objects would easily replace many unshared objects
  - The identity of each object does not matter
